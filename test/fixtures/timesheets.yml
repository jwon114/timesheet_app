one:
  date: <%= Date.today %>
  start_time: <%= Time.now.utc.seconds_since_midnight %>
  finish_time : <%= (Time.now.utc + 1.hour).seconds_since_midnight %>
  calculated_amount : 100
two: 
  date: <%= Date.today %>
  start_time: <%= (Time.now.utc + 2.hour).seconds_since_midnight %>
  finish_time : <%= (Time.now.utc + 4.hour).seconds_since_midnight %>
