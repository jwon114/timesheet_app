# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  date: <%= Date.today() %>
  start_time: <%= Time.now() %>
  finish_time: <%= Time.now() %>
  calculated_amount: 100
two: 
  date: <%= Date.today() - 1 %>
  start_time: <%= Time.now() %>
  finish_time: <%= Time.now() %>
  calculated_amount: 200
